                    <p>They can go for weeks without drinking water. The ability of the camels to stay for weeks without having to drink water led to them being nicknamed “ships of the desert.”
                        They store fat in parts of their bodies known as humps. Camels possess either one or two humps that are located on their backs. These humps exist for purposes of storing fats that the camels utilize for nourishment during the famine.
                        They can live for about 40 years. The life span of camels is 40 years. The young ones are born white in complexion. However, as they keep growing they grow brown skin.
                        Humps act as heat regulators for camels. During high temperatures in the desert, fatty acids stored within the camels’ humps minimize heat insulation leading to rising in the body temperatures to equal that of the environment.

                        Remarkable navigational abilities. Pigeons are famous for their remarkable navigational abilities. They use a range of aids, like using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’.
                        Excellent hearing abilities. Pigeons have consisted of those birds which have excellent hearing abilities. They can easily detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans.
                        Diet of the Pigeons. Pigeons are herbivores. They eat common food items like grains and seeds, vegetables, fruits, berries, insects, snails, earthworms, etc.
                        The pigeon as a messenger. In the past pigeons were used in communication. Many people conveyed messages through them, and it was the only source of communication.

                        Some chameleon species are able to change their skin colouration. Different chameleon species are able to vary their colouration and pattern through combinations of pink, blue, red, orange, green, black, brown, light blue, yellow, turquoise, and purple. Chameleon skin has a superficial layer which contains pigments, and under the layer are cells with guanine crystals. Chameleons change colour by changing the space between the guanine crystals, which changes the wavelength of light reflected off the crystals which changes the colour of the skin.

                        Pandas are probably the most easily recognized bear in the world. Their fur is starkly contrasting patches of black and white, with black ears and black eye patches. Their legs, shoulders, and tail are also black, and the rest of their body is white. Pandas, like most bears, have short tails, measuring between 4 and 6 inches long.The Panda bear is a large mammal native to central China. These bears are also known as giant pandas, or simply pandas. Though they famously dine on bamboo, pandas are bears, and scientists still classify them as carnivores. While they will occasionally feed on eggs, rodents, or birds, over 99% of this bear’s diet comes from bamboo plants. Read on to learn about the panda bear.

                        Cicadas are large insects made conspicuous by the courtship calls of the males. They are characterized by having three joints in their tarsi, and having small antennae with conical bases and three to six segments, including a seta at the tip. The Auchenorrhyncha differ from other hemipterans by having a rostrum that arises from the posteroventral part of the head, complex sound-producing membranes, and a mechanism for linking the wings that involves a down-rolled edging on the rear of the fore wing and an upwardly protruding flap on the hind wing.
